# hello-world
This repository is my repository that I'm creating for my CS50x course through eDx.org. It's a place to store my projects for the course.

Hi, my name is Zach. I am enrolled in a computer science course titled CS50x through the website eDx.org. I just completed my first project for the course using the MIT programming language, Scratch. I really enjoyed creating an interactive fantasy game and learning how to use the code in different ways as I went along. Also, I enjoyed going back over the code and recognizing how the design could be smoother and more aesthetic. I am tempted to make the game more advanced by creating my own graphics and "sprites", but I have to keep moving forward. It's fulfilling to learn coding and have something that I created to show for it.
