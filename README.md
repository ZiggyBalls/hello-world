# hello-world
This repository is my repository that I'm creating for my CS50x course through eDx.org. It's a place to store my projects for the course.

Hi, my name is Zach and I'm totally new to using my computer like this. This is getting a little advanced for me because as far as my computer science knowledge, I'm a novice but kind of always considered myself a power user on MacOS, which I'm finding out I'm not due to the new Power User Book for MacOS Big Sur that I just bought. Anyway, I'm enrolled in a computer science course titled CS50x through the website eDx.org. I just completed my first project for the course using the MIT programming language, Scratch. I really enjoyed creating an interactive fantasy game and learning how to use the code in different ways as I went along. Also, I enjoyed going back over the code and recognizing how the design could be smoother and then implementing those changes. I could totally add stuff to what I've already created but I have to keep moving forward. It's fulfilling to learn this stuff and have something that I created to show for it.
